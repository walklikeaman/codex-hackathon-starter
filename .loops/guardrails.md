# Project Guardrails

Hard constraints for this build. The agent reads this at session start. Add a
line whenever the same mistake happens twice, or when a decision must survive
the next teammate / the next Codex session. One-liners beat paragraphs.

---

## Guardrail: Never `git add -A` or `git add .`
Stage by explicit path only. A stray `.env` in a commit can leak a key that
kills both the demo and the account.

## Guardrail: Secrets live in env, never in code or git
`.env` is gitignored. No tokens in source, no tokens in commits, no tokens in
the Supabase MCP args that get committed.

## Guardrail: `ship` authorizes the complete production release
An explicit `ship` from the owner means: stage the agreed scope, commit, push,
mark the PR ready, wait for required checks, merge into `main`, deploy production,
and verify the public site. Do not stop after a preview or ask for a second
production confirmation. Without an explicit `ship`, use preview deployments.

## Guardrail: Protect the demo path
Before starting a new feature, confirm the one locked demo flow still works.
A green demo that does one thing beats a broken one that tries five.

## Guardrail: Inspect teammate changes before editing
Before every slice, fetch origin and inspect the dirty worktree, recent commits,
relevant branch diffs, and shared contracts. Never revert unknown changes; rebase,
integrate, or isolate the work so every teammate's contribution is preserved.

## Guardrail: One Next.js writer per checkout
Never run `next build` while `next dev` or another build uses the same checkout.
They share `.next` and concurrent writers can corrupt the dev/runtime manifest.

## Worktree falls back to its own branch — keep that branch on main

The agent worktree (`.claude/worktrees/<name>`) is bound to a branch such as
`claude/hackathon-prep-<id>`. Something in the environment periodically restores the
worktree to that branch, which showed up in the reflog as:

```
checkout: moving from main to HEAD
checkout: moving from <sha> to claude/hackathon-prep-27a66c
```

The effect is a silent time-machine: the tree jumps back to the commit the session
started at, while `origin/main` is far ahead. Nothing is lost (all work is pushed),
but edits made after a fallback land on stale files — once caught only because the
test count dropped from 280 to 130.

**Fix, applied 25.07:** keep the fallback branch pointing at main, so restoring it is
a no-op rather than a rewind:

```bash
git fetch origin -q
git branch -f claude/hackathon-prep-<id> origin/main
```

**Habit:** after any long tool run, check `git log --oneline -1` before editing. A
sudden drop in the test count is the loudest symptom.
