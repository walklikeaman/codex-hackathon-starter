# 🗺️ GloryMap Roadmap

> **Where we're going and why.** This is the roadmap — themed milestones over
> time. The concrete, pick-up-able tasks live as
> [GitHub issues](https://github.com/walklikeaman/codex-hackathon-starter/issues),
> grouped into [Milestones](https://github.com/walklikeaman/codex-hackathon-starter/milestones).

**Roadmap** = the themes and the order (this file).
**Backlog** = the prioritized list of concrete issues, ready to take
([open issues](https://github.com/walklikeaman/codex-hackathon-starter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)).

## How we work the board

- Each issue has a **theme** (`theme:*`), a **priority** (`P1`/`P2`/`P3`) and a
  **size** (`size-S/M/L`). Pick something that matches your time and interest.
- **Assign it to yourself**, move it in the milestone, open a `feature/<slug>`
  branch, and ship a PR (see [`TEAMWORK.md`](TEAMWORK.md)).
- Start with **P1** items in the lowest-numbered phase — they unblock the rest.
- 🟢 `good first issue` and `size-S` are the easiest on-ramps.

## 🎯 Phase 1 · Precision & Trust
**Goal:** make every pin trustworthy — city, street, or exact building, with its
source shown. Accuracy is the foundation everything else stands on.
**Milestone:** [Phase 1](https://github.com/walklikeaman/codex-hackathon-starter/milestone/1) · 6 issues

- Precision badge (city/street/building + source) · OSM building-footprint snap
- Dedup one place shared by many works · Wikipedia-prose AI enrichment (spike)
- Vision-verify AI/community locations · Fix-the-pin feedback loop

*Why first:* competitors hide precision; provable accuracy is our credibility
and unlocks better routes and trips.

## 📸 Phase 2 · Recreate the Shot 2.0
**Goal:** turn our signature feature into the best-in-class, web-first "stand
where the camera stood" experience.
**Milestone:** [Phase 2](https://github.com/walklikeaman/codex-hackathon-starter/milestone/2) · 6 issues

- Live-camera ghost overlay (ShotSync) · Edge-ghost contour alignment
- Compass navigator to the exact spot · AI alignment coach (vision + voice)
- "Film \| My photo" share card · My recreations gallery + community feed

*Why:* SetJetters charges for this and it's mobile-only — we do it free in the
browser, and the share cards drive organic growth.

## 🖼️ Phase 3 · Living Imagery
**Goal:** fresh, legally-clean photography for every place — no Street View
lock-in, community-fed, correctly attributed.
**Milestone:** [Phase 3](https://github.com/walklikeaman/codex-hackathon-starter/milestone/3) · 7 issues

- Source cascade Mapillary → Wikimedia → Street View · Before/after slider
- Community uploads with auto-moderation · Vision auto-attach uploads
- Universal attribution component · Report/DMCA flow · Cinema Trip Reel

*Why:* imagery is the wow, but Street View can't be stored — free-license
sources make before/after composites and sharing legal at scale.

## 🎧 Phase 4 · AI Guide on the Move
**Goal:** narration that unlocks on location and follows you as you walk — in
your language, grounded in sources.
**Milestone:** [Phase 4](https://github.com/walklikeaman/codex-hackathon-starter/milestone/4) · 8 issues

- Scene-nearby GPS-triggered narration · Walk mode (Wake Lock)
- Streaming narration · TTS cache · Multilingual · Genre-styled voice
- Fact-checked & sourced narration · Offline tour download

*Why:* this is the audio-guide genre's core loop (Autio/VoiceMap) — but tied to
**your** films and our verified places, not generic POIs.

## 📖 Phase 5 · Story Trails
**Goal:** follow a film or book by its **plot** — walk the story as it unfolds,
spoiler-safe. The most differentiated thing we can build.
**Milestone:** [Phase 5](https://github.com/walklikeaman/codex-hackathon-starter/milestone/5) · 7 issues

- Story-trail mode (numbered narrative path) · Spoiler shield
- Story-order ↔ walking-order toggle · Auto city-chapters
- Timeline scrubber · Character filter · Export/share a trail

*Why:* no competitor auto-generates a narrative-ordered trail from your own
library — and it unifies our films **and** books in one sequence.

## 🧭 Phase 0 · Product Polish *(parallel track)*
**Goal:** turn the demo into a product people keep — onboarding, a real profile,
check-ins and achievements.
**Milestone:** [Phase 0](https://github.com/walklikeaman/codex-hackathon-starter/milestone/6) · 4 issues

- Onboarding + interest selection · Interactive place card
- Bottom nav + profile · Check-in, progress, first achievement

*Why:* retention scaffolding — can be picked up anytime alongside the themed
phases (these are the original MVP issues #15/#19/#22/#23).
