# Location search — three paths with an anti-hallucination gate

All paths normalize into one location record with `relation_kind`
(filming_location | narrative_location) and `evidence_source` to distinguish provenance.
Code: `app/lib/location-search.mjs`, `app/lib/location-discovery-schema.mjs`; routes —
[[api-layer]].

**The rule every path obeys: a model may name a place, never locate one.** Names become
points through [[geocoding-cascade]].

## A title is not a question about the city on screen

A work search used to return only the places falling inside the currently viewed city.
Measured both ways: "Notting Hill" gave 1 place from London and **0 from Paris**;
"Amélie" gave 4 from Paris and **0 from London**. The map came back empty not because
the film's places are unknown, but because they are somewhere else.

A radius answers "what is near me". That is the right question for a place search and
the wrong one for a title search — somebody typing a film name is asking where that film
is, and the answer must not depend on where they happened to be standing.

So the radius decides what is marked as HERE, not what exists. `locationsByDistance`
returns every place the work touches, nearest first, each carrying `in_radius`, and the
response carries a `here` count. When nothing is in the current city the map moves to
the first result and says so.

Verified live: from London, "Amélie" now returns five places including Gare
d'Ermont-Eaubonne and the Porte des Lilas cinema, where it previously returned none.

**Two things this surfaced and did not fix.** Searching "Skyfall" matches Adele's lyric
video (Q57840000) rather than the film, so a correct title can still resolve to the
wrong entity. And the Wikidata place list per work is thin — one place for Notting Hill
— which is what [[film-permits]] and [[wikipedia-enrichment]] exist to widen.

## Path 1 — canonical ([[wikidata]])

nearby mode (geo-SPARQL around a point) or work mode (search for the work →
validate the type against the graph P31/P279 → locations via P915/P840). Only this path
emits a scene_match_token for [[film-imagery]] (real Q-ids + TMDB id).

## Path 2 — exploratory ([[openai]] web_search)

Enabled ONLY after a work search, if matched_work is found but there are < 3 locations.
The model searches for up to 5 places in the city and returns **a name and its citation**.
The server then hard post-filters:

- `sourceUrl` must canonically match a source `web_search` actually consulted (a Map built
  from `web_search_call` in `response.output`). Anything uncited is dropped — a remembered
  URL is not evidence.
- The name is geocoded through [[geocoding-cascade]], with the city being viewed passed as
  the `near` hint: "Cambridge" while looking at London is answerable, "Cambridge" on its
  own is refused.
- A refused name is returned under `unplaced` with its reason and is **never plotted**.
  The UI says so — "found three, could place one" and "found one" are different
  statements, and silence read as the wrong one.
- Only then meaningful: outside the city radius — dropped. Same Wikidata entity as
  something already on the map — dropped. Within 50 m of an existing place — dropped.

The id is now the **Q-id**, so a place found by both paths is recognised as one place
however differently the two sources spelled its name. It still gets no film still, but for
a different reason than before: only path 1 emits a scene_match_token.

### What #121 changed, and why it mattered

This path used to ask the model for `lat`/`lng`. Every check below it then validated the
invention rather than the place: the radius test only confirmed the made-up point was
*plausibly located*, the identity string `web-<slug>-<lat>-<lng>` baked it in, and the map
labelled the result "sourced" beside genuinely verified Wikidata places.

A recalled coordinate has no identity, only a position — which is why the same place found
twice used to become two places.

The point now carries its own provenance (`geocode_source`, `geocode_source_id`,
`geocode_reason`) separate from the claim's. The web source said the film shot here;
Wikidata said where here is. Those are different questions, and recording one source for
both makes the coordinate look as researched as the connection.

## Path 3 — Wikipedia prose (#47)

Offline, queued for review, never straight to the map. See [[wikipedia-enrichment]].

## Gotchas

- canonicalUrl strips the hash and the trailing "/", but NOT the query — a source with different
  query parameters won't match and the location will disappear.
- Incident 21.07: `format:"uri"` in the Zod schema → 502 (OpenAI Structured Outputs
  doesn't support it) — URLs in the model schema must be plain strings only.
- `existingLocations` carries an optional `wikidataId`. An older client that omits it
  still gets duplicate protection by distance, just weaker.
- The client deduplicates discover results by place name and coordinates
  ±0.0005.
