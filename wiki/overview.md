# GloryMap — project overview

Synthesis as of 22.07.2026, after a full read-through of the code (89 tests, ~4400 lines excluding
the frontend). Product: [[glorymap-app]] — a map of real places from your favorite
films, series, and books; a walking "story route" is built from a personal collection.
Brand: SceneMap → **GloryMap** (PR #31; internal names and localStorage keys
`scenemap-*` were kept on purpose).

## How it works (one paragraph)

The client is one big Leaflet component [[frontend]]. It talks to 7 server
routes [[api-layer]]: the city is geocoded via Nominatim, locations are searched live
in [[wikidata]] (P915 "filming location" / P840 "narrative location"), and when the
result is thin they're followed up via OpenAI web_search with mandatory source
verification ([[location-discovery]]). The personal library is imported from
Letterboxd ZIP / IMDb CSV and lives only in the browser ([[personal-library]]).
The film still for a location is picked by a vision model with a strict confidence threshold
([[film-imagery]]). The route is built by OSRM, tours by time budget and the audio guide —
[[tours-and-voice]]. "What's nearby" — [[nearby-geolocation]].

## Key facts that are easy to forget

- **Supabase is NOT used at runtime** — data is not persisted, everything is live
  from Wikidata + Next/CDN caches. The `locations`/`scenes` schema exists, but is empty
  ([[supabase]]).
- Demo fallback: until `/api/locations` responds, the map shows 10
  hardcoded London points — the app is never empty.
- Prod deploy is **manual** via a GitHub Actions gate; a merge into main gives only
  a staging preview ([[deployment-pipeline]]).
- The UI is strictly English-only (a contract after the PR #13 review).
- Models: `gpt-5.6-terra` (tours), `gpt-5-mini` (vision still matching),
  `gpt-4o-mini-tts` (voice), web_search — `gpt-5.6` ([[openai]]).
