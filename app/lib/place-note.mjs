// What was actually filmed here (#244).
//
// A pin said "Forrest Gump" and the card under it said "Filming location". Both are true
// and neither answers the question a person clicking a pin is asking, which is *what
// happens here* — which scene, which building plays what, why this corner is worth the
// walk. We were holding that answer the whole time and never showing it: every queue row
// carries `source_sentence`, the line of prose the place was found in.
//
// Measured over the 32,368 located rows, 12.09.2026:
//
//   moviemaps       30,122 rows   77% carry a description once the attribution is removed
//   movielocations   1,501 rows  100%
//   reelstreets        412 rows  100%
//   wikipedia          270 rows  100%
//   open_plaques        53 rows  100%
//   permit_record       10 rows    0%  — a permit is a date and an address, never a scene
//
// So **78% of the map can say what was shot there**, and the rest must say nothing rather
// than something invented. That is the whole design of this module: it subtracts, and when
// subtraction leaves nothing it returns null.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The three things it removes, each measured against real rows:
//
//   **The attribution tail.** 6,842 moviemaps rows are the literal string "Source: IMDb"
//   and nothing else. Printing that under a film title tells a reader where we looked, in
//   the place reserved for what they came to find out — and the popup already carries the
//   source as a link, which is a better answer to the same question.
//
//   **The "<Title> film location:" prefix.** Movie-Locations writes every line as
//   "Skyfall film location: the entrance to the MI6 underground facility: West Smithfield,
//   London". The title is printed directly above the note; repeating it costs the width
//   the description needs.
//
//   **The trailing address.** The same rows end with the street, which is the pin's own
//   name. Dropped only when it actually matches the place we are drawing — a segment that
//   does not match is part of the sentence, not a duplicate of the heading.

// Below this, what survived is not a description. "Diner" is, at 5 characters, so the floor
// is deliberately low — it is here to reject fragments of punctuation, not short answers.
