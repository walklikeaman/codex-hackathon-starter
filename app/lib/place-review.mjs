// Whether a proposed place may go on the map (#48).
//
// Everything in the graph today came from a Wikidata statement, so the map is currently
// safe by accident: nothing has ever tried to insert an unverified place. This module
// exists so that when an AI-discovered or community-submitted location can persist, it
// arrives `pending` and has to earn `verified`.
//
// The issue proposed gating on the vision frame-matcher. Measured, that matcher returns
// zero matches even for Skyfall against Glencoe and Harry Potter against Alnwick Castle,
// because a film's TMDB gallery is marketing material, not a location survey. A gate
// that admits nothing is an off switch, so verification is built from evidence that
// actually exists — and the frame match, when it fires, is a bonus rather than the bar.
//
// The governing lesson, learned by shipping a fabricated match: **demanding evidence is
// not the same as checking it.** So each signal below is a fact that can be looked up
// and disagreed with, not a model's assurance that it is satisfied.
