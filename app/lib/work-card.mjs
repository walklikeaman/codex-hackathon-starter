// from the film. Nothing has ever rendered the last one. The card is where that stops
// being a column in a response and starts being the thing that keeps the product honest.
//
// **Distance is the spine.** The owner wants places reached through the crew and through
// what influenced a work, and that is also the way this product could quietly start lying:
// "Harry Potter places" becoming "places connected to anything Rowling ever touched". So
// the card never prints one flat list. It prints blocks, in order, and the block for
// distance 2 is worded so that nobody reads it as a stop on a walk.
