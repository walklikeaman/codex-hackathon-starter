// scale table, the legacy migration's letterboxd-or-imdb guess, the file input's `accept`,
// the ZIP check, and the two connector cards. Adding a third service meant finding all
// seven, and missing one of them does not throw — it puts a whole library on the wrong
// scale, which is the failure this module exists to make impossible.

// nothing is lost, where halving IMDb would round 7 and 8 onto the same 3.5 stars.
