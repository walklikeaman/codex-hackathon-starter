// The guide that talks about what you walk past, without a route (#190).
//
// Walk mode already speaks on arrival — but only at the stops of a route somebody built
// first. This is the other way round: the trigger set is whatever is near the walker
// now, re-read as they move, and nothing has to be chosen before leaving the house.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// **The data is no longer sparse, and it is bunched.** #190 was written against a graph
// of 70 places and predicted one trigger every two kilometres. Measured on 2026-09-21,
// after the queue was promoted, with the 45 m radius walk mode already uses:
//
//   Hollywood Blvd, La Brea → Vine → Sunset   2.0 km   28 places   one every 72 m
//   Downtown LA, Broadway 3rd → 9th → Spring  3.0 km   35 places   one every 85 m
//   London, Trafalgar Sq → Soho → Covent Gdn  1.6 km   16 places   one every 97 m
//
// Walked in simulation at 4.2 km/h with a fix every 5 s, the real feed and the real
// sentences, the guide spoke 20, 24 and 8 times and was TALKING only 15%, 12% and 5% of
// the walk — a telling lasts 7 to 22 seconds. The places come in clusters (the Broadway
// theatres, a block of Soho), so the silences between clusters run to 4, 15 and 10
// minutes. Neither "one every two kilometres" nor "the guide never stops" is what this
// data does; the work here is choosing within a cluster: one voice at a time, a short
// breath after it, the better-evidenced place first, and never one building twice
// under two names.
//
// **The radius stays at 45 m.** Widening it was the plan when the data was sparse; now
// it only adds places across the block that the walker is not looking at.
//
// **What is said about an unchecked place is decided here, before any of it is spoken.**
// A hollow pin reads as "not checked" at a glance. Said into headphones in front of a
// building it reads as fact, and the walker cannot see the outline. So the qualifier
// comes FIRST — a sentence cut off after the claim must not be a stronger claim than we
// hold — and the source is named, because a spoken sentence needs a source a listener
// could check.
