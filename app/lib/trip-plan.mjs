// A day plan an outside agent can act on — and the labels that stop it lying.
//
// The owner plans his travel with a trip agent that is not this codebase. It wants
// something narrower than the map: "give me stops for an afternoon here, from these
// films, that I can actually walk to." Everything needed to answer that already existed
// in pieces — the queue reaches the map, `studio-lots.mjs` knows a fence from an address,
// `place-access.mjs` knows a gate from a street, `timed-tour.mjs` orders stops against a
// budget. What did not exist was one answer carrying all four at once.
//
// **The measurement that decided the shape of this file.** The obvious bridge is "export
// the verified graph". Measured against the city the owner is actually going to, on
// 2026-09-10 15:08 UTC:
//
//   places in the graph, worldwide                        70
//   places in the graph inside the Los Angeles viewport    1   — "Los Angeles", Q65,
//                                                              city precision, badge

//   queue rows inside the same viewport                4,665   (1 verified, 4,664 pending)
//
// So a bridge that exports only what we have verified answers a Los Angeles day with one
// stop, and that stop is the city the traveller is standing in. The bridge is therefore
// built on candidates, and **the labelling is not a courtesy on top of the payload — it
// is the payload**. Every stop states who said it and whether anybody checked.
//
// The second measurement, over the same 4,665 rows: **150 (3.2%) are inside a studio lot
// and 4,515 (96.8%) are on the street.** The 96.8% is the product. The 150 are the thing
// that would embarrass us — a backlot street printed beside a real address sends somebody
// to a gate they cannot pass, which is precisely the failure [[three-axes]] exists for.

// "Grauman's Chinese Theatre" (moviemaps), "Grauman’s Chinese Theatre, Hollywood
// Boulevard, Hollywood, Los Angeles" and "Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Hollywood Boulevard,
// Hollywood" (movielocations), 11 m apart. `timed-tour.mjs` merges two works at one point
// only when the NAME matches exactly, so three spellings stayed three stops and the walk
// went in a circle. This is the same duplicate the handoff records against `city_catalogue`
// ("Broadgate Tower" beside "Broadgate Tower, Bishopsgate, London"), reaching a second query.
//
// **Why this is not `canMerge`.** [[place-dedup]]'s rule is written for the graph and turns
// on `geocode_precision` and `place_class`, which a queue row does not carry — every
// candidate falls to precision "none" and is refused, so `dedupePlaces` collapses nothing
// here. Loosening `canMerge` to fix that would loosen it for the graph too, where the
// six closest pairs we hold are all genuinely different places. So this asks a narrower
// question with the same primitives.
//
// **Why the prefix rule and not `namesMatch`.** `namesMatch` allows one extra word, on
// purpose — it is what stopped "Notting Hill Bookshop" being read as the district. Here
// the extra words are an address the source glued onto the name, which is four or five
// words, so `namesMatch` refuses all three Grauman's spellings. A word-boundary prefix
// within 40 m is the honest reading of that, and the risk is bounded in a way the OSM case
// was not: this compares two of OUR OWN rows, both already at the same spot, and a wrong
// merge costs one fewer stop rather than a false claim about where something was filmed.
// Nothing is discarded — the merged stop carries every source and every work behind it.
// Two rows on the same coordinate are one place to WALK TO, whatever they are called.
//
// The second duplicate the Hollywood measurement turned up, and the prefix rule cannot
// reach it: "The Hollywood Roosevelt" (moviemaps) and "Roosevelt Hotel, Hollywood
// Boulevard, Hollywood" (movielocations) sit on 34.10125, -118.34178 — the same point to
// five decimals — and neither name is a prefix of the other. Left apart they are two stops
// with a zero-metre leg between them.
//
// This is a claim about walking and not about identity, which is why it is allowed here
// and would not be allowed in [[place-dedup]]: routing somebody to one coordinate twice is
// wrong however the two rows are named, while the graph's question — are these the same
