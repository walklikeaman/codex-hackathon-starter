// What makes a mention a CLAIM about this place rather than a word in a sentence.
//
// A normalised substring is not evidence — the same lesson as `Bowie` returning a
// hundred Texas markers about Jim Bowie and Bowie County. Two rules, measured:
//
// 1. CASE. A title on a wall is written as a title: "My Beautiful Laundrette", not
//    "the room" mid-sentence. Matching the ORIGINAL text case-sensitively took a set of
//    4,643 "hits" — dominated by "the club", "the beach", "the office" — down to 346.
//
// 2. PROXIMITY. In every true hit the title sits beside the word that makes it a claim:
//    "filming location The Blackwood Arms", "location for film Moby Dick", "Stars of the
//    film 'Brassed Off'". In the noise it opens a sentence about a 16th-century pub.
//    346 → 46, and a pub called The Crown stopped being the series The Crown.
