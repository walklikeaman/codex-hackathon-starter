// How much of somebody's film library we actually hold — answered without their library
// ever leaving the browser.
//
// Reported from a real import: **2,422 films from a Letterboxd ZIP, "0 mapped titles".**
// The ZIP parsed fine. The count was computed against `films`, which is
// `worksFromLocations(sourceLocations)` — the works belonging to the locations loaded for
// the CITY IN VIEW. So 2,422 titles were being compared with the eleven films the map
// happened to be drawing in London, and zero is the arithmetically correct answer to a
// question nobody asked.
//
// Measured on production the same day: the catalogue holds 7,063 works, and **6,075 of
// them have at least one located row**. That is the number a library should be compared
// with.
//
// The reason this is a matcher over a downloaded INDEX rather than a request carrying the
// library is the promise printed under the import button: *"The ZIP or CSV is processed
// locally and is never uploaded."* Sending 2,422 titles to a server to be matched would
// break it for a feature whose whole appeal is that it does not. So the catalogue comes to
// the library instead — 6,075 rows of title, year and identifier, which is small.
