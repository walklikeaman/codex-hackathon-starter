// Where the map is, as an address somebody can send.
//
// Measured 10.09.2026: the map opens on London and there is **no way to open it anywhere
// else by link.** `londonCenter` and `Q84` are hard-coded initial state, and nothing reads
// the URL. Every other surface in this product got an address — a work in #146, a city and
// the directory in #158, a place in #129 — and the main one, the map itself, never did.
//
// It matters most to the person who is actually travelling: "open my map on Los Angeles"
// is a link, or it is four clicks through a dropdown that has to be scrolled past four
// films of the same name. It is also why the map cannot be linked from the city pages,
// which is the obvious way in.
//
// **A city slug is preferred to a coordinate** where one fits, for the reason [[directory]]
// gives: a slug survives the anchor being re-measured, and `?city=los-angeles` says what
// it means where `?lat=34.0597` does not. A raw coordinate is still accepted, because the
// map can be dragged anywhere and most places are not in the gazetteer.
//
// Related: [[work-url]], [[directory]], [[studio-lots]].
