// What is worth seeing in the part of the map you are looking at (#201).
//
// The panel could say how MANY films are in view and never which ones mattered. "994 films
// · 2,480 places" is a quantity, and the question a visitor actually arrives with is
// "what is this place famous for" — which nothing answered.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// **Famous is not the same as highly rated, and conflating them produces a wrong list.**
//
// IMDb's rating alone puts a 9.2 with 300 votes above Forrest Gump. That film is not
// famous; it is obscure and liked by the few who found it. Vote count alone has the
// opposite fault: it ranks by how many people watched, so a bad film everybody saw beats a
// great one most did not.
//
// So the score multiplies the two, with the votes on a log scale because fame is
// multiplicative — the step from 1,000 to 10,000 voters means far more than 1,000,000 to
// 1,010,000. Worked on real rows from the Los Angeles set:
//
//   Forrest Gump      8.8 × log10(2,532,967) = 8.8 × 6.40 = 56.3
//   The Big Lebowski  8.1 × log10(  924,249) = 8.1 × 5.97 = 48.4
//   90210             6.2 × log10(   47,724) = 6.2 × 4.68 = 29.0
//   Fred & Vinnie     5.9 × log10(      165) = 5.9 × 2.22 = 13.1
//
// which is the order a person would give if asked what Los Angeles is known for.

// Below this the rating is not a measurement, it is a handful of opinions. 165 voters
// decide a score to one decimal place, and that score should not be allowed to rank
// anything. Excluded outright rather than down-weighted: a list called "worth seeing"
// should not quietly include something nobody has seen.
export const MIN_VOTES = 1000;

// `Number(null)` is 0 and `Number.isFinite(0)` is true, so a film with NO rating scored a
// perfectly valid zero and stayed in the list. It would sort last — until a view held fewer
// than five rated works, and then an unrated one would be presented as worth seeing. The

// The two public sources, and how a TMDB vote compares with an IMDb one (#224).
//
// Measured on the 4,919 works that carry both, 2026-10-02:
//
//   IMDb votes per TMDB vote     53× median   (41× and 68× at the quartiles)
//   correlation of log votes     0.977
//   TMDB votes at ~1,000 IMDb    22 median    (162 works between 800 and 1,250)
//   TMDB score − IMDb score      −0.07 mean, 0.52 sd — the same 0–10 habit
//
// So the scores can stand side by side, and the vote counts cannot: TMDB's audience is
// fifty times smaller. Held to IMDb's floor of 1,000, TMDB could rank 1,943 works and
// looked like a source that would lose 60% of "Known for" — which is what #224 first
// concluded. Held to the same floor in TMDB's own votes (1,000 / 53 = 19) it ranks 4,433,
// against IMDb's 4,808. The rest are works TMDB does not list at all.
