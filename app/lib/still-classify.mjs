// Telling a frame from the film apart from a poster of it.

// TMDB files both under "backdrops": genuine production stills sit next to gun-barrel
// key art, title treatments and cast montages. No metadata field separates them —
// verified on Skyfall, whose promotional art carries the same "textless" marking as a
// real still, because a silhouette honestly contains no text. It is simply not a frame
// from the film, and that is a judgement about the picture, not about its metadata.
//
// So the picture gets looked at. This is a deliberately NARROW question — "is this a
// photographic frame from the film?" — with no place involved, which makes it far
// cheaper than the scene matcher AND permanently cacheable: the answer for a given
// image file never changes, so every image is paid for once, ever.
//
// Matching a frame to a PLACE is a different, harder question and stays where it is,
// in scene-image-match.mjs. This module only decides what belongs in a gallery.
