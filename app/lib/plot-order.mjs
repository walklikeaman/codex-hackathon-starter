// A story trail ordered by the plot as it is written down, not as a model remembers it.
//
// The story trail walks a film's locations in the order the story reaches them. Until now
// the order came from a model's memory, and measured on 2026-10-02 that memory could not be
// trusted with it: given Sherlock Holmes (2009), its 13 known locations and what each plays,
// gpt-5-mini returned three different orders in three runs, and never put the crypt — the
// film's opening scene — first. The order is not decoration here: a scene's spoiler tier is
// its place in the story, and the trail hides what the reader has not reached yet.
//
// So the model no longer decides the order. It is shown the film's plot from Wikipedia and,
// for each location, asked to COPY the passage where that scene happens. The passage is
// then looked up in the plot text by this code: found, and its position is the scene's
// place in the story; not found, and the scene is dropped. Measured on the same film: two
// runs, every returned quote found verbatim, both runs in the same order — cell, vault,
// Sir Thomas's house, Westminster, the bridge — and the crypt, which the plot summary does
// not mention, left out rather than put somewhere wrong.
//
// What is kept per scene: the location (one of ours, chosen from a closed list), what it
// appears as (from the location guide, not the model), and the quote that placed it —
// which is the evidence for the order, and is kept with the article it came from.
