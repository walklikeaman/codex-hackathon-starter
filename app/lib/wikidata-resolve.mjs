// Finding the Wikidata entity that IS a submission's place — pure helpers.
//
// The existing cascade (geocode-wikidata.mjs) runs the other way: a name from
// prose, out comes a coordinate. Here the coordinate is already known and the
// entity is what is missing, which is a much easier question — the search is
// bounded to 150 m rather than the whole planet, so "Cambridge or Cambridge"
// never arises.
//
// Rules were chosen by measurement, not taste. On 196 real MovieMaps pins:
//
//   exact label                      47 (24.0%)   2 ambiguous
//   + alternative labels             54 (27.6%)   3 ambiguous
//   + one name contains the other    49 (25.0%)  24 ambiguous   <- rejected
//   + generic word dropped           58 (29.6%)   6 ambiguous   <- chosen
//
// Containment was the surprise: it resolves FEWER than the strict rule, because
// a substring catches neighbours, the case turns ambiguous, and an ambiguous
// case is correctly thrown away. A rule that looks looser can be worse.
//
// The ceiling is the data. 138 of those 196 had SOME entity within 150 m but
// only 58 matched by name — the rest are genuine neighbours. In a city there is
// almost always something notable within a block, so proximity alone proves
// nothing, and Wikidata simply does not hold an entry for an ordinary house.
