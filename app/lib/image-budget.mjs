// What an image is allowed to weigh, and where that number came from (#198).
//
// Images were the one thing in this product nothing was measured against. Every other
// cost has a number somebody can argue with — a tile is 25 kB (tile-corridor.mjs), a
// corridor is capped at 400 of them — and images had none, so they arrived one feature
// at a time and nobody could name the one that did it.
//
// Measured on production, 2026-09-21, and every number below is a mean over ten real
// files rather than a guess:
//
//   image.tmdb.org, poster (2:3)   w92 5 kB · w154 10 · w185 14 · w342 36 · w500 73 · w780 153
//   image.tmdb.org, frame (16:9)   w92 3 kB · w185  7 · w300 13 · w342 16 · w500 27 · w780  58
//   commons, Special:FilePath      no width: 5.1 MB mean, 7.0 MB max · ?width=400: 57 kB
//
// The last line is the one that mattered. `location-search.mjs` stored the P18 image URL
// exactly as Wikidata states it — `Special:FilePath/<file>` with no width — and 15 of the
// 15 places in a central-London viewport carried one. That is the full original upload,
// five megabytes on average, rendered into a figure 192 CSS px wide.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// **The budget is per surface, not per page.** "The app should be under N MB" cannot be
// enforced, because the number of images on screen depends on what is in view. What can
// be enforced is that every image is asked for at the size it is drawn at — so the table
// below names each one's box, in CSS pixels, taken from globals.css, and the test holds
// the code to it.
//
// **Two device pixels per CSS pixel, and no more.** Phones report 3 and even 4, and
// serving for those doubles the bytes for a difference nobody has been shown to see on a
// photograph. Every box here is therefore budgeted at ×2.

// The widths image.tmdb.org actually serves. TMDB documents a different list per image
