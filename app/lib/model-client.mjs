// One place that decides which model provider a call goes to, and in what shape.
//
// The shape is not a detail. Measured against OpenRouter live:
//
//   POST /api/v1/responses with text.format  → HTTP 200, status "completed",
//                                              and the schema SILENTLY IGNORED.
//                                              The body came back as the model's
//                                              reasoning prose.
//   POST /api/v1/chat/completions
//        with response_format json_schema    → schema honoured, valid JSON.
//
// A structured-output request that returns 200 and unstructured text is the worst
// failure available: nothing throws, and the caller sees a parse error far from the
// cause. So everything goes through chat/completions, which BOTH providers honour —
// one code path rather than a provider abstraction.
//
// Support is per-ENDPOINT, not per-model. One provider serving a model advertises
// structured outputs and another does not, which is how a schema failure reproduces
// 40% of the time and never in dev. `require_parameters` refuses an endpoint that
// cannot do what we asked, rather than quietly downgrading.
