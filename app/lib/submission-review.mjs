// A verdict on one row of the queue, and the reason it can be argued with.
//
// Measured 08.08: **43,888 submissions, every one `pending`, none ever reviewed.** The
// number is usually read as "nobody has clicked yet". It is not. Three things came out
// of measuring the corpus before writing a line of this:
//
//   * **30,153 of the 30,257 geolocated rows are MovieMaps alone.** Their names are
//     clean (22 characters on average) and their coordinates are one per place — 3,187
//     of 3,313 name-clusters hold exactly ONE distinct point. So the obvious offline
//     check, "do the rows agree with each other", proves nothing: they are the same
//     number copied, not independent observations.
//   * **13,841 rows have no coordinate at all**, and mostly cannot get one, because
//     their `place_name` is not a name — it is a caption. 47% of movie-locations rows
//     run past twelve words and 54% still carry the "<Film> location:" prefix the
//     extractor was supposed to cut. No geocoder resolves a sentence.
//   * Everything that would actually settle a MovieMaps row — is there a Wikidata entity
//     here, does another site say the same thing — needs the network.
//
// So a human queue of 30,257 rows is not a product: the reviewer would have no more
// information than we do. What this module does instead is say, per row and in words a
// person can check, **which of those three situations the row is in** — and verify the
// rows whose claim somebody outside this project can already check.
//
// The vocabulary of evidence is `place-review.mjs`. It was written for `places` and has
// had no caller since; using it here is deliberate, because two definitions of "what
// counts as evidence" is how the two surfaces start disagreeing.
