// What a pin means, decided in one place.
//
// The map grew three pin systems from three code paths and never reconciled them: an amber
// diamond for a searched work's places, a filled circle for the graph, a hollow circle for
// the queue. A reader was asked to learn three shapes for one idea — *a place* — and the
// owner's verdict on 11.09 was the right one: **"почему одни жёлтые ромбики, а другие
// кружочки? Не понимаешь, что это означает."**
//
// So there is ONE shape now, and the things that actually differ are the things that vary:
//
//   how many films are here  → the NUMBER printed on the pin, and its size
//   have we checked it       → filled (checked) against outlined (nobody has looked)
//   what kind of place       → amber for somewhere you can stand, violet for a studio lot
//   is it the one you picked → a ring around it, which never changes the other three
//
// A number on the pin is the part that was missing and the part that was asked for. 566 of
// the 2,024 Los Angeles points carry more than one film and the busiest carries 96; without
// the number every one of them looks like a single place, which is what hid 71% of the data
// before the points were grouped at all.

// `marker.setIcon()` on all of them, and `setIcon` replaces the marker's DOM element. The
// cost was not the pins being on screen — it was rebuilding all of them whenever ANY state
// in the app changed. Opening the layers menu with 598 pins drawn blocked the main thread
// for 220 ms; with 10 pins drawn, 45 ms. Nothing about the pins had changed either time.
//
// Sharing is safe because `DivIcon.createIcon()` builds a NEW element per marker — the icon
// object is a recipe, not the thing on the map. So the key has to cover exactly what the
// recipe reads: the html (which is the label plus the classes) and the size.
