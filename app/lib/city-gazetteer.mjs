// The cities the directory offers (#158) — a coordinate and a radius each, never a name.
//
// **Why this file is data and not a query.** The obvious way to build a city directory is
// to group the located rows by the city written in their address. Measured on 18.08.2026
// against production, that gives:
//
//   "London"       spread 10,959 km   — London, Ontario is also called London
//   "Richmond"     spread  8,097 km   — British Columbia, Virginia, and upon Thames
//   "Ontario"         48 works        — a province, and also a city in California
//   "Unnamed Road"    80 works        — not a place at all
//   "France"         190 works        — a country, whose median point is Paris
//
// A name in an address is a LABEL. Only a point is an identity. So a city page here is a
// disc: an anchor and a radius, and the films on it are the films with a located row
// inside it. The name is decoration, exactly as the readable half of a work slug is
// ([[work-url]]) — which is why London, Ontario cannot appear on the London page however
// its address is spelled, and why Paris appears whether the address says "Paris", "75001"
// or nothing at all.
//
// **How this list was derived**, by `scripts/build-city-gazetteer.sql` against production:
//
//   1. Every comma-separated component of every located row's `area_hint` is a candidate.
//   2. A candidate is dropped when it is a COUNTRY — measured as the share of occurrences
//      where it is the LAST component. Canada scores 1.000, France 0.912, Ireland 0.813;
//      Vancouver, Madrid and Almería score 0.000. Without this rule "Canada" wins 902
//      names, lands on Vancouver's coordinate, and shadows Vancouver itself.
//   3. A candidate is dropped when it names one address rather than an area: fewer than
//      three DISTINCT full hints behind it. This is what removes "Mini Hollywood",
//      "Bryant Park", "Tate Modern" and "Bonneville Salt Flats", each of which otherwise
//      arrives with 40-50 works and looks exactly like a small city.
//   4. The anchor is the MEDIAN of its own points, which is what survives homonyms: a
//      third of everything called "Paris" is in Texas or Ontario and the median is still
//      in the 4th arrondissement. The mean is not — it lands in the Atlantic. Nor is the
//      densest point, which was tried and moved London to Greenwich, where 51 rows share
//      one coordinate.
//   5. A candidate is dropped when its interquartile spread exceeds 50 km, so a name that
//      means several places is not given one page.
//   6. Of two candidates within 40 km, only the more-named survives. This is the rule that
//      makes the directory a directory rather than a padded one: at a 20 km radius
//      Westminster, Lambeth, St. James's and City of Westminster return the SAME 656 works
//      as London, and each would have been its own page.
//
// **One entry was added by hand and it is marked.** Paris fails rule 5 because two thirds
// of the rows naming it are Paris, Texas and Paris, Ontario — the rule is right about the
// name and wrong about the place, and we hold 123 works within 20 km of the anchor its own
// median gives. It is added rather than the threshold loosened, because loosening it to
// admit Paris also admits "s/n" (Spanish for "no street number"), which was measured to
// take 87 works and shadow Madrid.
//
// **What this list is not.** It is Anglo-American by construction, because our sources are:
// Prague, Rome and Vienna hold too few rows to clear rule 1, and they are absent rather
// than padded. The counts shown to a reader are always LIVE — this file carries no numbers,
// only anchors, so the directory can never quote a total it no longer holds.

import { slugifyTitle } from "./work-url.mjs";

// 20 km, and the number is doing work. Rule 6 keeps accepted anchors more than 40 km
// apart, so at 20 km no two discs overlap and no film is counted into two cities. A wider
// radius would swallow Long Beach into Los Angeles and make the two counts add to more
// than we hold.
