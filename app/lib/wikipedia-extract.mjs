// Pulling filming locations out of Wikipedia prose (#47).
//
// Two rules from earlier mistakes are built into the shape of this, not bolted on:
//
// 1. **The model is given no way to output a coordinate.** The story-trail extractor
//    got this right and the web-discovery path got it wrong (#121) — it asks a model
//    for lat/lng, so a pin lands wherever the model happened to remember. Here the
//    model returns a NAME; the geocoder turns names into points from sources.
//
// 2. **The quote is checked, not trusted.** The scene matcher demanded that the model
//    justify itself, got a fluent and specific justification, and shipped a fabricated
//    match — the sentence described a different photograph entirely. Demanding evidence
//    is not the same as checking it. So every returned sentence must be found VERBATIM
//    in the prose we supplied; one that is not simply drops its location.

// twelve places in Skyfall's Production section — correctly, it names London, Istanbul,
