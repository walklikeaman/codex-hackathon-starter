// One film, at an address (#146).
//
// Everything on this page already existed and nothing rendered it. `/api/work` has
// answered with the sentence each source stated, the precision badge, the evidence count
// and — since #129 — how many degrees each place stands from the film, and the only
// surface in the product was a map you had to drag to. 6,392 works hold at least one
// located place; none of them had a URL.
//
// **Rendered on the server, deliberately.** The point of the page is that a link to it can
// be sent, opened cold and indexed. A client-side fetch would give a shareable URL whose
// content is invisible to anything that does not run JavaScript, which is most of what
// receives a shared link.
//
// The route handler is called directly rather than over HTTP: it is a function in this
// same process, and a server component fetching its own API needs an absolute origin it
// has no reliable way to know.
