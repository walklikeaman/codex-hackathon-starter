// The door the trip agent knocks on (#trip-agent).
//
// **What this route is, and what it deliberately is not.** The owner plans travel with an
// agent that is not this codebase, and the four shapes that agent could take — an MCP
// server, a third-party product with its own API, a custom GPT, or something he is still
// building — want four different transports and the SAME answer. This is the answer. It is
// the part every one of the four needs: an MCP tool wraps this, a GPT action calls it, a
// product integration posts to it, an export saves what it returns. The transport that
// wraps it is not built here, because which one to build is a question only the owner can
// settle and guessing it would be the expensive kind of wrong.
//
// **Why POST and not GET.** The body may carry the traveller's own film list. That list
// lives in the browser's localStorage and has never left it ([[personal-library]]); the one
// way to keep that true while still filtering by it is for the CLIENT to pass the titles it
// wants matched. A URL is the wrong place for them — it is logged, cached and refer(r)ed —
// so they travel in a body, are compared in memory, and are never written down. When a
// library is present this route refuses edge caching outright.
//
// **What it may never do** is hand over an unchecked queue row shaped like a verified
// place. In Los Angeles that is not a corner case, it is the whole city: measured
// 2026-09-10 15:08 UTC, the graph holds ONE place inside the LA viewport (the city
// centroid) against 4,665 queue rows. Every stop states which store it came from and who
// said it.
