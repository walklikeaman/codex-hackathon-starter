// One place, at an address — and the answer to the question a film card cannot answer
// (step 4 of #129).
//
// A film card shows every place in one film. This shows every film at one place, and the
// difference is not cosmetic: 6 of the 70 places in the graph carry facts from more than
// one subject, and those six are exactly the pages no work card can ever show. Trafalgar
// Square is three films; a reader standing in it deserves all three.
//
// Rendered on the server for the same reason `/work/[slug]` is: the point of a page is
// that its link can be sent, opened cold and indexed, and a client-side fetch gives a URL
// whose content is invisible to most of what receives a shared link. The route handler is
// called directly rather than over HTTP — it is a function in this same process, and a
// server component fetching its own API needs an absolute origin it cannot reliably know.
