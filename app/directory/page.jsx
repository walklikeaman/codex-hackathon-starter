// The directory index (#158). The third surface, and the first one a search engine can
// walk: until this page existed, 6,392 works and 32,148 located rows were reachable only
// by typing a title into a box or dragging a map to them.
//
// Rendered on the server for the same reason the film card is — a page whose whole purpose
// is to be linked to and indexed cannot depend on JavaScript running. The route handlers
// are called directly rather than over HTTP: they are functions in this process, and a
// server component fetching its own API needs an absolute origin it cannot reliably know.
