// This replaces `<MapContainer>` from react-leaflet and everything under it. The reason is
// measured rather than fashionable: Leaflet draws one DOM element per pin, and dragging Los
// Angeles with 1,008 of them up runs at 30 fps against 120 fps for the same places as a GPU
// layer (#197). Two further reasons came out of the work — the app was shipping BOTH engines
// (`maplibre-gl` was already a dependency, used only as a backdrop inside Leaflet), and
// `react-leaflet` is licensed Hippocratic-2.1, which is not an OSI licence.
//
// The API here deliberately mirrors the shape the app already used — a component that owns
// the map, children that draw into it, a hook that reaches it — so the swap is a change of
// engine rather than a change of architecture.
