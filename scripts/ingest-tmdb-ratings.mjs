// **Why TMDB and not Rotten Tomatoes.** #224 opens by saying Rotten Tomatoes is already
// ingested and the map simply cannot see it. Measured 20.09.2026, that is not the shape of
// the problem: RT covers 10 works of 7,063 and Metacritic 10, while IMDb covers 5,495. The
// map can see the only source that has coverage.
//
// What IMDb does not have is a licence. Its published dataset is non-commercial use only,
// and every "Known for" list, rating filter and sort rests on it. TMDB's terms allow
// commercial use with attribution, and TMDB is already integrated here for posters — so
// the replacement is not a better number, it is a number we are allowed to keep using.
//
// The obstacle was never the API. It was the key: a TMDB id is recorded on 12 works, an
// IMDb id on 6,044. `/find/{imdb_id}?external_source=imdb_id` turns one into the other, so
// this script buys coverage rather than a new dependency.
