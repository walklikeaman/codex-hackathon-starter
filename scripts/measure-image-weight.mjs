// `test/image-budget.test.mjs` holds the code to a budget using numbers written down in
// `app/lib/image-budget.mjs`. This is where those numbers come from, and the reason it is
// a script rather than a test: it goes out to image.tmdb.org, commons.wikimedia.org and
// the live app, which is the wrong thing to do on every commit and the right thing to do
// before changing a budget.
//
// It reports four things:
//
//   1. the size ladder — mean bytes per rung, over real files, per shape;
//   2. the live map — what a viewport's worth of places actually carries;
//   3. the drift — each budgeted surface measured against what it is allowed;
//   4. the JavaScript — the shared first-load bundle, if this checkout has been built.
//
// A rung that moves by a few percent is the CDN recompressing; a rung that moves by a
// factor is a policy change upstream and the table in image-budget.mjs is now a lie.
