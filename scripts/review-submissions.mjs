// had to go through the Supabase MCP as `postgres`. With `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in the

// this queue is 227 kB of id lists that nobody reads before running it anyway. `--sql`
// stays for the case where somebody wants to read the decisions before they land.
//
// The rules live in `app/lib/submission-review.mjs` with the measurements that produced
// them. This file only fetches, applies them, and counts.
//
// Every UPDATE carries its own reason, and the reasons are grouped, so the run is
// readable as a table afterwards: a review whose verdicts cannot be counted by kind is a
// review nobody can disagree with.
